The history, purpose, use and philosophy of moldy will be here :).

# History

Moldy was created thanks to the need to have a structure to start any project for example: You want to create a CLI in Python for that most of the CLI have their own structures but Moldy wants to standardize that and also advertise to new languages ​​with project templates and of new languages

# Why moldy?

Moldy alludes to the word "Mold in Spanish" because its objective is to create project templates (and rush a create-react-app sshh don't tell anyone) and we add a "Y" to make this name more familiar. it was my own the name was created by a friend who prefers to be anonymous

# Use

Moldy is designed for people with a minimum knowledge of CLI, therefore its use and commands are the simplest and most complete, in case a documentation is needed, it is in the process of being created when the documentation is ready I will place the link here in the in case you want to help with the documentation it is intended to be done with hugo and this topic [link here](https://getdoks.org/) any contribution is welcome

# Philosophy

A simple but powerful tool without thousands of commands but in case you need them to develop a template you can read the devs part in the future documentation, in the future it is planned to create a GUI for Moldy in case you want to help with that you can enter the discord link in which they will talk about mold and the new features
